God the Father:</h4>There is one and only one living and true God.  He is the maker and supreme ruler of heaven and earth. In the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, equal in every way, yet exercising distinct roles in the work of redemption.  (I Corinthians 8:6; Psalms 90:2; I John 5:7; Exodus 20:2-3; I Corinthians 12:4-6 (trinity)<h4>2.  The Bible:</h4>Also called the Word of God.  We believe the King James Version of the Bible to be the faithful translation for English speaking people, and the sixty-six books contained in it to be the total of inspired writings.  That it is to be accepted as our only guide in the faith and practice.  We believe it to be verbally inspired, inerrant, infallible, God breathed, and indestructible.  It alone will be used as the guide in all matters of church discipline.  (II Timothy 3:16,17; John 10:35; John 16:12; Luke 21:33; II Peter 1:20,21).<h4>3.  Jesus Christ:</h4>We believe that He is the only begotten Son of God, and that true faith in Him is the only means of salvation.  The Saviour took our place as a substitutionary sacrifice for our sin, was buried, and arose again the third day for our justification.  We believe in His preexistence, virgin birth, incarnate deity, present intercession, and second coming.  (Ephesians 2:8,9; II Corinthians 5:21; I Corinthians 15:3,6,51,53; John 8:58; John 10:30; I Timothy 2:5; Titus 3:5).<h4>4.  The Holy Spirit:</h4>We believe that He is the third person of the triune God, that He is the life giving agent in salvation, our help in understanding the Scriptures, emphasizing our prayers, discovers to us our sins, indwells every believer throughout life, making order out of chaos, and sealing every believer until the day of redemption.  (I Corinthians 12:13; Romans 8:5,27; Ephesians 1:13,14; II John 5:6,7).<h4>5.  The Church:</h4>We believe it is made up of born again people called out of this world unto Jesus Christ.  It may also be known as the body of Christ.  However, it can only be recognized as such when a local group gets together.  Its main function is witnessing and testifying.  Its continual function is that of teaching and preaching.<h4>6.  The Ordinances:</h4>We believe the Scriptures teach that there are two Christian ordinances, baptism and the Lord’s supper; that there is no saving merit in them, but rather they portray our faith in Jesus Christ; that baptism is the total immersion in water of a believer in Christ to show forth, in a solemn and beautiful emblem, our faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Saviour; that the Lord’s supper is a provision of unleavened bread and the pure unfermented fruit of the vine as symbols of Christ’ body, and blood, partaken of by believers in Christ, in commemoration of our Lord’s suffering and death;  that its observance is to be preceded by faithful self-examination.  Romans 6:4; I Cor. 11:26; Luke 22:19-20; I Cor. 11:23-34.<h4>7.  Heaven and Hell:</h4>We believe heaven to be a place prepared for those who accept Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour, and hell to be a place prepared for the devil and all those persons who fail to accept Jesus Christ.  (Luke 16:19, 31: John 14:2,3; Matthew 25:41,46).<h4>8.  Christian Service:</h4>We believe that all members of this church should engage in some definite work in its behalf:  that they should pray for it, with it, teach in and out of it; seeking to bring the lost under its ministry.  We also believe that the person should be respected, remembered, and encouraged.<h4>9.  Giving:</h4>We further believe that one of the best evidences of faith and the leading factor in personal and church prosperity is obedience in tithing:  meaning one-tenth of the increase, placed in the church treasury on the first day of the week as often as it is received.  (Ephesians 4:1; Titus 2:11,15; Malachi 3:10,12; I Corinthians 16:1,2; Romans 14:12).');?>
