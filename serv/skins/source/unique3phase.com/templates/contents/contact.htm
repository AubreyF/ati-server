<h3>Most people ask questions based on their knowledge of how rotary converters work:</h3>

There are some similarities and some differences. They are similar in that each method uses a transformer to generate the third leg. The rotary is acting like a mechanical transformer. The transformer method just uses a transformer. The rotary as you probably know can run multiple motors. So can the transformer method. The rotary converter can run multiple motors with out capacitors and start relays at each motor. That is true, but look at the penalty in wasted electricity or running back and forth to turn it on and off. If your time is valuable then the tendency is to start it up, and leave it run. But now your valuable time is being eroded away by an electricity hog. Plus I have seen where some times the rotary user, to get a decent balance will have some capacitors at each machine to 'finish' balance it. Well if you are going to have capacitors at each machine what's the difference? You see the transformer method gets you started on the right foot to begin with. Then you can balance each machine. If you need to reverse and constantly start stop a machine you always have the flexibility to add a small idle motor into the system to run that specific machine. But it would be sized for that machine and still run off the transformer and be started and stopped at that machine. Mean while the rest of your machines would still be run from the transformer and started and stopped at each machine with no wasted electricity.
