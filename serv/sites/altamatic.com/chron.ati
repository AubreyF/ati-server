		The Gregorian calendar was proclaimed by Pope Gregory XIII, and took
		effect in most Catholic states in 1582, in which October 4, 1582 of
		the Julian calendar was followed by October 15 in the new calendar.
		When comparing historical dates,
		it\'s important to note that the Gregorian calendar, used universally
		today in Western countries and in international commerce, was
		adopted at different times by different countries.  Britain and 
		her colonies (including what is now the United States), did not switch
		to the Gregorian calendar until 1752, when Wednesday 2nd September
		in the Julian calendar dawned as Thursday the 14th in the Gregorian.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The Gregorian calendar is a minor correction to the Julian.  In the
		Julian calendar every fourth year is a leap year in which February has
		29, not 28 days, but in the Gregorian, years divisible by 100 are
		<em>not</em> leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.
		As in the Julian calendar, days are considered to begin at midnight.

		Astronomers frequently need to do arithmetic
		with dates. Julian days simply enumerate the days
		and fraction which have elapsed since the start of the
		<em>Julian era</em>, which is defined as beginning at noon
		on Monday, 1st January of year 4713 B.C.E. in the Julian
		calendar.  This date is defined in terms of a cycle of years,
		but has the additional advantage that all known historical astronomical
		observations bear positive Julian day numbers, and periods can
		be determined and events extrapolated by simple addition and
		subtraction. The Julian
		day notation is so deeply embedded in astronomy that it is unlikely
		to be displaced at any time in the foreseeable future. It is also an ideal
		system for storing dates in computer programs, free of cultural bias
		and discontinuities at various dates, and can be readily transformed
		into other calendar systems.

		While any event in recorded human history can be written as
		a positive Julian day number, when working with contemporary
		events all those digits can be cumbersome.  A <em>Modified
		Julian Day</em> (MJD) is created by subtracting 2400000.5
		from a Julian day number, and thus represents the number of
		days elapsed since midnight (00:00) Universal Time on
		November 17, 1858.  Modified Julian Days are widely used to
		specify the epoch in tables of orbital elements of
		artificial Earth satellites.  Since no such objects existed
		prior to October 4, 1957, all satellite-related MJDs are
		positive.

		The Julian calendar was proclaimed by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.
		and underwent several modifications before reaching its final
		form in 8 C.E.  The Julian calendar differs from the Gregorian
		only in the determination of leap years, lacking the correction
		for years divisible by 100 and 400 in the Gregorian calendar.
		In the Julian calendar, any positive year is a leap year if
		divisible by 4.  (Negative years are leap years if the absolute value
		divided by 4 yields a remainder of 1.)  Days are considered to
		begin at midnight.
		<br /><br />		
		In the Julian calendar the average year has a length of 365.25 days.
		compared to the actual solar tropical year
		of 365.24219878 days.  The calendar thus accumulates one day of
		error with respect to the solar year every 128 years.
		Being a purely solar calendar, no attempt is made to synchronise the
		start of months to the phases of the Moon.

		The Hebrew (or Jewish) calendar attempts to simultaneously
		maintain alignment between the months and the seasons and
		synchronise months with the Moon--it is thus deemed a
		"<em>luni-solar calendar</em>".  In addition, there are constraints
		on which days of the week on which a year can begin and to shift
		otherwise required extra days to prior years to keep the
		length of the year within the prescribed bounds.
		This isn\'t easy, and the
		computations required are correspondingly intricate.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Years are classified as <em>common</em> (normal) or
		
		<em>embolismic</em> (leap) years which occur in a 19 year
		cycle in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19.  In an
		embolismic (leap) year, an extra <em>month</em> of 29 days,
		"Veadar" or "Adar II", is added to the end of the year after
		the month "Adar", which is designated "Adar I" in such
		years.  Further, years may be <em>deficient</em>,
		<em>regular</em>, or <em>complete</em>, having respectively
		353, 354, or 355 days in a common year and 383, 384, or 385
		days in embolismic years.  Days are defined as beginning at
		sunset, and the calendar begins at sunset the night before
		Monday, October 7, 3761 B.C.E. in the Julian calendar, or
		Julian day 347995.5.  Days are numbered with Sunday as day 1,
		through Saturday: day 7.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The average length of a month is 29.530594 days, extremely close
		to the mean <em>synodic month</em> (time from new Moon to
		next new Moon) of 29.530588 days.  Such is the accuracy that
		more than 13,800 years elapse before a single day
		discrepancy between the calendar\'s average reckoning of the
		start of months and the mean time of the new Moon.
		Alignment with the solar year is better than the Julian
		calendar, but inferior to the Gregorian.  The average length
		of a year is 365.2468 days compared to the actual solar tropical
		year (time from equinox to equinox) of 365.24219 days, so
		the calendar accumulates one day of error with respect to
		the solar year every 216 years.

		The Islamic calendar is purely lunar and consists of twelve alternating
		months of 30 and 29 days, with the final 29 day month extended to
		30 days during leap years.  Leap years follow a 30 year cycle
		and occur in years 1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, and 29.
		Days are considered to begin at sunset.  The calendar begins
		on Friday, July 16th, 622 C.E. in the Julian calendar, Julian
		day 1948439.5, the day of Muhammad\'s flight from Mecca to Medina,
		with sunset on the preceding day reckoned as the first day of
		the first month of year 1 A.H.--"<em>Anno Hegiræ</em>"--the Arabic word
		for "separate" or "go away".  Weeks begin on Sunday, and the
		names for the days are just their numbers: Sunday is the first
		day and Saturday the seventh.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Each cycle of 30 years thus contains 19 normal years of 354
		days and 11 leap years of 355, so the average length of a
		year is therefore ((19 ? 354) + (11 ? 355)) / 30 =
		354.365...  days, with a mean length of month of 1/12 this
		figure, or 29.53055...  days, which closely approximates the
		mean <em>synodic month</em> (time from new Moon to next new
		Moon) of 29.530588 days, with the calendar only slipping one
		day with respect to the Moon every 2525 years.  Since the calendar
		is fixed to the Moon, not the solar year, the months shift
		with respect to the seasons, with each month beginning about
		11 days earlier in each successive solar year.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The calendar presented here is the most commonly used
		civil calendar in the Islamic world; for religious purposes
		months are defined to start with the first observation of
		the crescent of the new Moon.

		The modern Persian calendar was adopted in 1925, supplanting
		(while retaining the month names of) a traditional
		calendar dating from the eleventh century.  The calendar
		consists of 12 months, the first six of which are 31
		days, the next five 30 days, and the final month 29
		days in a normal year and 30 days in a leap year.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As one of the few calendars designed in the era of accurate
		positional astronomy, the Persian calendar uses a very complex
		leap year structure which makes it the most accurate solar
		calendar in use today.  Years are grouped into <em>cycles</em>
		which begin with four normal years after which every fourth
		subsequent year in the cycle is a leap year.  Cycles are grouped
		into <em>grand cycles</em> of either 128 years (composed of
		cycles of 29, 33, 33, and 33 years) or 132 years, containing
		cycles of of 29, 33, 33, and 37 years.  A <em>great grand
		cycle</em> is composed of 21 consecutive 128 year grand cycles
		and a final 132 grand cycle, for a total of 2820 years.  The
		pattern of normal and leap years which began in 1925 will not
		repeat until the year 4745!
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Each 2820 year great grand cycle contains 2137 normal
		years of 365 days and 683 leap years of 366 days,
		with the average year length over the great grand cycle
		of 365.24219852.  So close is this to the actual
		solar tropical year of 365.24219878 days that the
		Persian calendar accumulates an error of one day
		only every 3.8 million years.  As a purely solar
		calendar, months are not synchronised with the
		phases of the Moon.

		The Mayans employed three calendars, all organised as hierarchies
		of cycles of days of various lengths.  The <em>Long Count</em> was
		the principal calendar for historical purposes, the <em>Haab</em>
		was used as the civil calendar, while the <em>Tzolkin</em>
		was the religious calendar.  All of the Mayan calendars
		are based on serial counting of days without means for synchronising
		the calendar to the Sun or Moon, although the Long Count and Haab
		calendars contain cycles of 360 and 365 days, respectively, which
		are roughly comparable to the solar year.  Based purely on counting
		days, the Long Count more closely resembles the
		Julian Day system and contemporary computer representations of
		date and time than other calendars devised in antiquity.
		Also distinctly modern in appearance is that days and
		cycles count from zero, not one as in most other calendars,
		which simplifies the computation of dates, and that numbers
		as opposed to names were used for all of the cycles.

		The Long Count calendar is organised into the
		hierarchy of cycles shown at the right.
		Each of the cycles is composed of 20 of the next
		shorter cycle with the exception of the <em>tun</em>,
		which consists of 18 <em>uinal</em> of 20 days each.
		This results in a <em>tun</em> of 360 days, which maintains
		approximate alignment with the solar year over modest
		intervals--the calendar comes undone from the
		Sun 5 days every <em>tun</em>.

		<p>
		The Mayans believed at at the conclusion of each
		<em>pictun</em> cycle of about 7,885 years the universe is
		destroyed and re-created.  Those with apocalyptic
		inclinations will be relieved to observe that the present
		cycle will not end until Columbus Day, October 12, 4772 in
		the Gregorian calendar.  Speaking of apocalyptic events,
		it\'s amusing to observe that the longest of the cycles in
		the Mayan calendar, <em>alautun</em>, about 63 million
		years, is comparable to the 65 million years since the
		impact which brought down the curtain on the dinosaurs--an
		impact which occurred near the Yucatan peninsula where,
		almost an <em>alautun</em> later, the Mayan civilisation
		flourished.  If the universe is going to be destroyed and
		the end of the current <em>pictun</em>, there\'s no point in
		writing dates using the longer cycles, so we dispense
		with them here.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Dates in the Long Count calendar are written, by convention,
		as:
		</p>
		
		<p align="center">
		<em>baktun</em>&nbsp;<b>.</b>&nbsp;<em>katun</em>&nbsp;<b>.</b>&nbsp;<em>tun</em>&nbsp;<b>.</b>&nbsp;<em>uinal</em>&nbsp;<b>.</b>&nbsp;<em>kin</em>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		and thus resemble present-day IPV4 Internet addresses!
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For civil purposes the Mayans used the <em>Haab</em>
		calendar in which the year was divided into 18 named periods
		of 20 days each, followed by five <em>Uayeb</em> days
		not considered part of any period.  Dates in this
		calendar are written as a day number (0 to 19 for regular
		periods and 0 to 4 for the days of <em>Uayeb</em>) followed
		by the name of the period.  This calendar has no concept of
		year numbers; it simply repeats at the end of the complete
		365 day cycle.  Consequently, it is not possible, given a
		date in the Haab calendar, to determine the Long
		Count or year in other calendars.  The 365 day cycle
		provides better alignment with the solar year than the 360
		day <em>tun</em> of the Long Count but, lacking a leap year
		mechanism, the Haab calendar shifted one day with
		respect to the seasons about every four years.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The Mayan religion employed the <em>Tzolkin</em> calendar,
		composed of 20 named periods of 13 days.  Unlike the
		Haab calendar, in which the day numbers increment
		until the end of the period, at which time the next period
		name is used and the day count reset to 0, the names and numbers
		in the Tzolkin calendar advance in parallel.  On each
		successive day, the day number is incremented by 1, being
		reset to 0 upon reaching 13, and the next in the cycle of twenty
		names is affixed to it.  Since 13 does not evenly divide 20,
		there are thus a total of 260 day number and period names before
		the calendar repeats.  As with the Haab calendar, cycles
		are not counted and one cannot, therefore, convert a Tzolkin
		date into a unique date in other calendars.  The 260 day cycle
		formed the basis for Mayan religious events and has no relation
		to the solar year or lunar month.

		The Mayans frequently specified dates using <em>both</em> the Haab
		and Tzolkin calendars; dates of this form repeat only
		every 52 solar years.

		The Bahá\'í calendar is a solar calendar organised as a
		hierarchy of cycles, each of length 19, commemorating the 19
		year period between the 1844 proclamation of the Báb in
		<a href="/images/eclipse99/iranimages.html#Shiraz" target="_blank">Shiraz</a> and
		the revelation by Bahá\'u\'lláh in 1863.  Days are named in a
		cycle of 19 names.  Nineteen of these cycles of 19 days,
		usually called "months" even though they have nothing
		whatsoever to do with the Moon, make up a year, with a
		period between the 18th and 19th months referred to as
		<em>Ayyám-i-Há</em> not considered part of any month; this
		period is four days in normal years and five days in leap
		years.  The rule for leap years is identical to that of the
		Gregorian calendar, so the Bahá\'í calendar shares its
		accuracy and remains synchronised.  The same cycle of 19
		names is used for days and months.
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The year begins at the equinox, March 21, the Feast of
		Naw-Rúz; days begin at sunset.  Years have their own
		cycle of 19 names, called the <em>Váhid</em>.  Successive cycles of
		19 years are numbered, with cycle 1 commencing on March 21, 1844,
		the year in which the Báb announced his prophecy.
		Cycles, in turn, are assembled into <em>Kull-I-Shay</em>
		super-cycles of 361 (19?) years.  The first <em>Kull-I-Shay</em>
		will not end until Gregorian calendar year 2205.  A week of seven
		days is superimposed on the calendar, with the week considered to
		begin on Saturday.  Confusingly, three of the names of weekdays
		are identical to names in the 19 name cycles for days and months.

		A bewildering variety of calendars have been and continue to be
		used in the Indian subcontinent.  In 1957 the Indian
		government\'s Calendar Reform Committee adopted the National
		Calendar of India for civil purposes and, in addition,
		defined guidelines to standardise computation of the
		religious calendar, which is based on astronomical
		observations.  The civil calendar is used throughout India
		today for administrative purposes, but a variety of
		religious calendars remain in use.  We present the civil
		calendar here.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The National Calendar of India is composed of 12 months.
		The first month, <em>Caitra</em>, is 30 days in normal
		and 31 days in leap years.  This is followed by five
		consecutive 31 day months, then six 30 day months.  Leap
		years in the Indian calendar occur in the same years as
		as in the Gregorian calendar; the two calendars thus
		have identical accuracy and remain synchronised.
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Years in the Indian calendar are counted from the start of
		the Saka Era, the equinox of March 22nd of year 79 in the
		Gregorian calendar, designated day 1 of month
		Caitra of year 1 in the Saka Era.  The calendar was
		officially adopted on 1 Caitra, 1879 Saka Era, or
		March 22nd, 1957 Gregorian.  Since year 1 of the Indian
		calendar differs from year 1 of the Gregorian, to
		determine whether a year in the Indian calendar is a leap
		year, add 78 to the year of the Saka era then
		apply the Gregorian calendar rule to the sum.

		The French Republican calendar was adopted by a
		decree of <em>La
		Convention Nationale</em> on Gregorian date October 5, 1793
		and went into effect the following November 24th, on which
		day Fabre d\'Églantine proposed to the <em>Convention</em>
		the names for the months.  It incarnates the revolutionary
		spirit of "Out with the old!  In with the relentlessly
		rational!" which later gave rise in 1795 to the metric
		system of weights and measures which has proven more durable
		than the Republican calendar.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The calendar consists of 12 months of 30 days each, followed
		by a five- or six-day holiday period, the
		<em>jours complémentaires</em> or
		
		<em>sans-culottides</em>.  Months are grouped into four
		seasons; the three months of each season end with the same
		letters and rhyme with one another.  The calendar begins on
		Gregorian date September 22nd, 1792, the September
		equinox and date of the founding of the First Republic.
		This day is designated the first day of the month of
		Vendémiaire in year 1 of the Republic.  Subsequent years
		begin on the day in which the September equinox occurs as
		reckoned at the Paris meridian.  Days begin at true solar
		midnight.  Whether the <em>sans-culottides</em> period
		contains five or six days depends on the actual
		date of the equinox.  Consequently, there is no leap year rule
		<em>per se</em>: 366 day years do not recur in a regular
		pattern but instead follow the dictates of astronomy.  The
		calendar therefore stays perfectly aligned with the seasons.
		No attempt is made to synchronise months with the phases of
		the Moon.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The Republican calendar is rare in that it has no
		concept of a seven day week.  Each thirty day month
		is divided into three <em>décades</em> of ten days
		each, the last of which, <em>décadi</em>, was the
		day of rest.  (The word "<em>décade</em>" may
		confuse English speakers; the
		French noun denoting ten years is "<em>décennie</em>".)
		The names of days in the <em>décade</em> are derived from
		their number in the ten day sequence.  The five or
		six days of the <em>sans-culottides</em> do not bear
		the names of the <em>décade</em>.  Instead, each of these holidays
		commemorates an aspect of the republican spirit.
		The last, <em>jour de la Révolution</em>, occurs only
		in years of 366 days.
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Napoléon abolished the Republican calendar in favour
		of the Gregorian on January 1st, 1806.  Thus France, one
		of the first countries to adopt the Gregorian calendar
		(in December 1582), became the only country to subsequently
		abandon and then re-adopt it.  During the period of the
		Paris Commune uprising in 1871 the Republican calendar
		was again briefly used.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The original decree
		which established the Republican calendar contained a
		contradiction: it defined the year as starting on the day
		of the true autumnal equinox in Paris, but further prescribed
		a four year cycle called <em>la Franciade</em>, the fourth
		year of which would end with <em>le jour de la Révolution</em>
		and hence contain 366 days.  These two specifications are
		incompatible, as 366 day years defined by the equinox do
		not recur on a regular four year schedule.  This problem was
		recognised shortly after the calendar was proclaimed, but the
		calendar was abandoned five years before the first conflict
		would have occurred and the issue was never formally resolved.  Here
		we assume the equinox rule prevails, as a rigid four year
		cycle would be no more accurate than the Julian calendar, which
		couldn\'t possibly be the intent of its enlightened Republican
		designers.

		The
		<a href="http://www.iso.ch/" target="_blank">International Standards Organisation</a>
		(ISO) issued
		Standard ISO 8601, "Representation of Dates" in 1988,
		superseding the earlier ISO 2015.  The bulk of the standard
		consists of standards for representing dates in the
		Gregorian calendar including the highly recommended
		"<b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>" form which is unambiguous, free of cultural
		bias, can be sorted into order without rearrangement, and is
		Y9K compliant.  In addition, ISO 8601 formally defines the
		"calendar week" often encountered in commercial transactions
		in Europe.  The first calendar week of a year: week 1, is
		that week which contains the first Thursday of the year (or,
		equivalently, the week which includes January 4th of the
		year; the first day of that week is the previous Monday).
		The last week: week 52 or 53 depending on the
		date of Monday in the first week, is that which contains
		December 28th of the year.  The first ISO calendar week of a
		given year starts with a Monday which can be as early as
		December 29th of the previous year or as late as January
		4th of the present; the last calendar week can end as late
		as Sunday, January 3rd of the subsequent year.
		ISO 8601 dates in year, week, and day form are written
		with a "W" preceding the week number, which bears a leading
		zero if less than 10, for example February 29th, 2000
		is written as 2000-02-29 in year, month, day format and
		2000-W09-2 in year, week, day form; since the day number
		can never exceed 7, only a single digit is required.
		The hyphens may be elided for brevity and the day number
		omitted if not required.  You will frequently see date of
		manufacture codes such as "00W09" stamped on products; this
		is an abbreviation of 2000-W09, the ninth week of year 2000.

		<p>
		In solar calendars such as the Gregorian, only days and
		years have physical significance: days are defined by the
		rotation of the Earth, and years by its orbit about the Sun.
		Months, decoupled from the phases of the Moon, are but a
		memory of forgotten lunar calendars, while weeks of seven days
		are entirely a social construct--while most calendars in use
		today adopt a cycle of seven day names or numbers, calendars
		with name cycles ranging from four to sixty days have been
		used by other cultures in history.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		ISO 8601 permits us to jettison the historical and cultural
		baggage of weeks and months and express a date simply by
		the year and day number within that year, ranging from 001
		for January 1st through 365 (366 in a leap year) for
		December 31st.  This format makes it easy to do arithmetic
		with dates within a year, and only slightly more complicated
		for periods which span year boundaries.  You\'ll
		see this representation used in project planning and for specifying delivery
		dates.  ISO dates in this form are written as "<b>YYYY-DDD</b>",
		for example 2000-060 for February 29th, 2000; leading zeroes
		are always written in the day number, but the hyphen may be
		omitted for brevity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		All ISO 8601 date formats have the advantages of being
		fixed length (at least until the Y10K crisis rolls around) and, when
		stored in a computer, of being sorted in date order
		by an alphanumeric sort of their textual representations.
		The ISO week and day and day of year calendars are
		derivative of the Gregorian calendar and share its accuracy.

		<p>
		Development of the Unix operating system began at Bell Laboratories
		in 1969 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, with the first
		PDP-11 version becoming operational in February 1971.  Unix wisely
		adopted the convention that all internal dates and times (for example,
		the time of creation and last modification of files) were kept in
		Universal Time, and converted to local time based on a per-user
		time zone specification.  This far-sighted choice has made it
		vastly easier to integrate Unix systems into far-flung networks
		without a chaos of conflicting time settings.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Many machines on which Unix was initially widely deployed
		could not support arithmetic on integers longer than 32 bits
		without costly multiple-precision computation in software.
		The internal representation of time was therefore chosen to be
		the number of seconds elapsed since
		00:00 Universal time on January 1, 1970 in the Gregorian
		calendar (Julian day 2440587.5), with time stored as a 32
		bit signed integer (<tt>long</tt> in early C implementations).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The influence of Unix time representation has spread well beyond
		Unix since most C and C++ libraries on other systems provide
		Unix-compatible time and date functions.  The major drawback of
		Unix time representation is that, if kept as a 32 bit signed
		quantity, on January 19, 2038 it will go negative, resulting in
		chaos in programs unprepared for this.  Unix and C
		implementations wisely (for reasons described below) define the
		result of the <tt>time()</tt> function as type <tt>time_t</tt>,
		which leaves the door open for remediation (by changing the
		definition to a 64 bit integer, for example) before the clock
		ticks the dreaded doomsday second.
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		C compilers on Unix systems prior to 7th Edition lacked the
		32-bit <tt>long</tt> type.  On earlier systems <tt>time_t</tt>,
		the value returned by the <tt>time()</tt> function, was an array
		of two 16-bit <tt>int</tt>s which, concatenated, represented the
		32-bit value.  This is the reason why <tt>time()</tt> accepts a
		pointer argument to the result (prior to 7th Edition it returned
		a status, not the 32-bit time) and <tt>ctime()</tt> requires a
		pointer to its input argument.  Thanks to Eric Allman (author
		of <tt>sendmail</tt>) for
		pointing out these historical nuggets.

		<h4>1900 Date System (PC)</h4>
	
		<p>
		Spreadsheet calculations frequently need to do arithmetic with date
		and time quantities--for example, calculating the interest on a loan
		with a given term.  When Microsoft Excel was introduced for the PC
		Windows platform, it defined dates and times as "serial values", which
		express dates and times as the number of days elapsed since midnight
		on January 1, 1900 with time given as a fraction of a day.  Midnight
		on January 1, 1900 is day 1.0 in this scheme.  Time zone is
		unspecified in Excel dates, with the <tt>NOW()</tt> function returning
		whatever the computer\'s clock is set to--in most cases local time, so
		when combining data from machines in different time zones you usually
		need to add or subtract the bias, which can differ over the year due
		to observance of summer time.  Here we assume Excel dates represent
		Universal (Greenwich Mean) time, since there isn\'t any other rational
		choice.  But don\'t assume you can always get away with this.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You\'d be entitled to think, therefore, that conversion back and
		forth between PC Excel serial values and Julian day numbers would
		simply be a matter of adding or subtracting the Julian day number
		of December 31, 1899 (since the PC Excel days are numbered from 1).
		But this is a <em>Microsoft</em> calendar, remember, so one must
		first look to make sure it doesn\'t contain one of those bonehead
		blunders characteristic of Microsoft.  As is usually the case,
		one doesn\'t have to look very far.  If you have a copy of PC
		Excel, fire it up, format a cell as containing a date, and
		type 60 into it: out pops "February 29, 1900".  News apparently
		travels <em>very</em> slowly from Rome to Redmond--ever since
		Pope Gregory <a href="IG_Latin.html" target="_blank">revised the calendar</a>
		in 1582, years divisible
		by 100 have <em>not</em> been leap years, and consequently the
		year 1900 contained no February 29th.  Due to this morsel of
		information having been lost somewhere between the Holy See and
		the <a href="/documents/top10.html">Infernal</a> Seattle monopoly,
		all Excel day numbers for days subsequent to February 28th, 1900
		are one day greater than the actual day count from January 1, 1900.
		Further, note that any computation of the number of days in
		a period which begins in January or February 1900 and ends in a
		subsequent month will be off by one--the day count will be one
		greater than the actual number of days elapsed.

		By the time the 1900 blunder was discovered, Excel users had
		created millions of spreadsheets containing incorrect
		day numbers, so Microsoft decided to leave the error in place
		rather than force users to convert their spreadsheets, and the
		error remains to this day.  Note, however, that <em>only 1900</em>
		is affected; while the first release of Excel probably also
		screwed up all years divisible by 100 and hence implemented a
		purely Julian calendar, contemporary versions do correctly
		count days in 2000 (which is a leap year, being divisible by
		400), 2100, and subsequent end of century years.

		PC Excel day numbers are valid only between 1 (January 1, 1900) and
		2958465 (December 31, 9999).  Although a serial day counting scheme
		has no difficulty coping with arbitrary date ranges or days before
		the start of the epoch (given sufficient precision in the representation
		of numbers), Excel doesn\'t do so.  Day 0 is deemed the idiotic
		January 0, 1900 (at least in Excel 97), and negative days and
		those in Y10K and beyond are not handled at all.  Further, old
		versions of Excel did date arithmetic using 16 bit quantities
		and did not support day numbers greater than 65380 (December
		31, 2078); I do not know in which release of Excel this 
		limitation was remedied.

		<h4>1904 Date System (Macintosh)</h4>
		
		<p>
		Having saddled every PC Excel user with a defective date
		numbering scheme wasn\'t enough for Microsoft--nothing ever is.
		Next, they proceeded to come out with a Macintosh version
		of Excel which uses an <em>entirely different</em> day numbering
		system based on the MacOS native time format which counts
		seconds elapsed since January 1, 1904.  To further obfuscate
		matters, on the Macintosh they chose to number days from zero
		rather than 1, so midnight on January 1, 1904 has serial
		value 0.0.  By starting in 1904, they avoided screwing up 1900
		as they did on the PC.  So now Excel users who interchange data
		have to cope with two incompatible schemes for counting days, one
		of which thinks 1900 was a leap year and the other which
		doesn\'t go back that far.  To compound the fun, you can now
		select either date system on either platform, so you can\'t be
		certain dates are compatible even when receiving data from
		another user with same kind of machine you\'re using.  I\'m
		sure this was all done in the interest of the "efficiency"
		of which Microsoft is so fond.  As we all know, it would take a computer
		<em>almost forever</em> to add or subtract four in order to make everything
		seamlessly interchangeable.
