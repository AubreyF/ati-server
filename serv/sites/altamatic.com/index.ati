It can now properly autodetect morse code, and doesn\'t enter "permutator" mode unless the code does indeed contain a sequence of 7 non broken symbols		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">071126: Introducing Gadgets!</div>			Altamatic takes a huge leap forward with the introduction of <a href="/gadgets" class="boldText">Gadgets</a> - super handly tools organized by tags - all merged into a unified, effecient launcher.			The Chronometry, Hieroglyphics, and Linguistics pages have all been merged into the gadget system, and more cool gadgets are on the way!		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">071124: One Time Pads</div>			One Time Pad generator has been added to <a href="/print">Printables</a> section!<br />			Minor cryptography tuneup to enhance automatic mode detection of binary code		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">071017: Cryptography and Linguistics Tune Up</div>			Instructional text for the Cryptography system has been been re-written to cover all the features that have been added over the last couple months, A "Transcription Visualizer" has been added, A "Statistics" box that provides frequency analysis info is now shown for all methods when in "Decipher" mode, and many more digital hashing methods have been added!<br />			The linguistics section has also been organized a bit better, with hieroglyphics and translation each on their own page.		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">071016: Printables</div>			<div class="italicText">New "<a href="/print">Printables</a>" section added, with three printable pages of handy code solving tools.</div>			The printable sheets were actually created a while ago for Jamestown (Hence the "hunt" reference :-), but they just got the final polish and were added to the site.		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">071015: Morse Morphing</div>			<div class="italicText">The cyptography system can now calculate random permutations for non broken morse character sequences, and solve them automatically!</div>			This can be really helpful to solve morse sequences after the spacing has been lost (whether unintentionally or deliberately :-)! To try it out, enter a sequence of more than 7 morse code characters in a row (with no spaces) in the cryptography system.		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">071011: Attack of the Ads</div>			<div class="italicText">AltaMatic is being hijacked by contextual advertising!</div>			Not quite... But after nearly 6 months of ad free existence, a couple ads have been added here and there. Don\'t mind them - they won\'t bite - and you just might find something that interests you!		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">071010: Core Upgrades</div>			<div class="italicText">AltaMatic, along with the rest of the ATI Network, has just undergone a major templating system upgrade. You can now select multiple "themes" to view AltaMatic in via the "My Settings" menu in the upper right corner of the page!</div>		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">071004: New Name</div>			<div class="italicText">Spy Tools has "graduated" from being a mere subdomain of the theati.net, and now gets it\'s own full name as AltaMatic.com!</div>			Yes - we will all miss "Spy Tools", but the domain wasn\'t available - and I am planning to add some more tools in the future that will be useful to more than just spies...		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">071002: New Server</div>			<div class="italicText">All of the ATI Network has been moved over to a new server!</div>			Spy Tools should be lightning fast again, and some more cool features are in the works.		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">070507: Morse Tweaks</div>			Thanks to a suggestion by "Tim", the morse codes for x and y are correct and we now have many more characters.		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">070505: Major Update</div>			<i>Tons of new features and improvements!</i>			<ul>				<li><b>Index:</b> Less junk, and a new "Announcements" section (which you are reading right now). Past announcements will be filled in from my memory :-)</li>				<li><b>Cryptography:</b>					Totally redone! The entire cryptography system is now much more organized, and can now solve and scramble text.					The different "methods" have been reorganized, and I have added a new one called "digital".					The "Smart Detection" system has been taken to the next level, and can now intelligently pick the correct mode to solve many basic ciphers (more coming soon).					Besides rewriting all the previous algorithyms to be able to scramble and solve, I have also added new algorithyms for Binary, Base 64, Hexidecimal, MD5 (one way), L33T (just for fun), Morse Backwards, and "Pig Lattin".					I am also working on adding intelligent "tips" all throught the code breaking process to make things self explanatory!				</li>				<li><b>Translation, Hieroglyphics, Chronometry:</b> Shined up quite a bit. Formatting is more consistent and intuitive!</li>			</ul>			<div class="italicText">Looks like the <a href="http://my.statcounter.com/project/standard/stats.php?project_id=2434611&guest=1" target="_blank">stats</a> are about to pass 5,000 views. Good work - and be sure to tell all your friends!</div>			As always, if there is anything you feel could be improved on SpyTools, <b>please <a href="/contact">>> let me know</a></b>		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">070502: Cryptography - Smart Text Detecting and Morse Code</div>			The Cryptography system can now automatically detect certain kinds of text in the "Simple Obfuscation Solver" mode (such as the brand new Morse Code)		</div>		<div class="odd">			<div class="boldText">0704(20-30): More Features</div>			Brand new chronometry and translation pages - with tons of different calendars to learn about and convert, and quite a few languages to translate between!		</div>		<div class="even">			<div class="boldText">070412: Release</div>			SpyTools is released! Spytools started out as a simple PHP script to solve caesar ciphers for the <a href="http://visionforum.com/jamestown400">Jamestown 400</a>, but quickly evolved more features as the need arose to solve more types of clues. For example, when I needed to solve a hieroglyphics puzzle - I compared every hieroglyphics dictionary on the net and made my own better one! After a while the collection of tools I had was large enough I felt it would be useful to other people, and so I made this site...		</div>	</div>');?>
