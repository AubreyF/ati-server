Thanks goes to all these persons who have helped:

richard@joffray.com
  Fixed a problem the list of directories, if one accessed the
  root-directory.

Robert Niess <sturm@i-st.net>
  Made me aware of a security hole in the handling of stderr-trapping.

Gerry Calderhead <caldergf@everythingsucks.co.uk>
  Patch for PHP 4.2.0 where register_globals are turned off.

Jeremy Miller <JMiller@marketaxess.com>
  Suggested that one could use Sudo from

    http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/

  to let PHP Shell execute code with different privileges than the
  webserver.

Michael Zech <keldrin@web.de>
  Patch to make the stderr-checkbox remember it's state.

Wolfgang Dautermann <wolfgang.dautermann@fh-joanneum.at>
  Multiple patches, including the sorting of directory entries in the
